# NAB (Numenta Anomaly Benchmark) Dataset Project

## Dataset

The NAB (Numenta Anomaly Benchmark) dataset is a comprehensive collection of time series data designed for benchmarking anomaly detection algorithms. It includes data from various sources such as real network traffic, real applications, and synthetic data.

we decided to work with the twitter volume data that showcases twitter  mentions of large publicly traded companies such as Apple, Google, IBM. 

The metric value represents the number of mentions for a given ticker symbol every 5 minutes

### Dataset Statistics

- **Total Number of Files:** 58
- **Total Number of Anomalies:** 1,122
- **Percentage of Anomalies:** Approximately 5%
- **Sources:** Real network traffic, real applications, and synthetic data
- **Data Types:** Time series data with labeled anomalies

The dataset can be accessed on Kaggle: [NAB Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/boltzmannbrain/nab)

## Use Cases

1. **Time Series Anomaly Detection in Industrial Applications:**
   - Develop and test models to detect anomalies in sensor data, aiding in predictive maintenance and reducing downtime.

2. **Network Traffic Analysis:**
   - Develop models to detect unusual patterns in network traffic indicative of cybersecurity threats.

3. **Financial Fraud Detection:**
   - Enhance fraud detection systems by training models to detect irregular transaction patterns.
